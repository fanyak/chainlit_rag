To Merge changes from the Original Repo:
1. Add the Original Repo as "Upstream" Remote
If you haven't already, add the original repository as a remote called upstream:
bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Chainlit/chainlit.git

Now there are 2 remotes (origin for the forked repo and upstream for the original repo)
You can see the remotes with:
bash
git remote -v 
  origin    https://github.com/fanyak/chainlit_rag.git (fetch)
  origin    https://github.com/fanyak/chainlit_rag.git (push)
  upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/chainlit_rag.git (fetch)
  upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/chainlit_rag.git (push)

Process:
You *push* changes to origin (your fork). (git push -u origin main the 1st time and then git push)
You *fetch* updates from upstream.
You *merge* from upstream/main into your local branches as needed.

2. Fetch Changes from Upstream
bash
git fetch upstream

3. Checkout Your Local Main (or master) Branch
bash
git checkout main

4. Merge Upstream Changes Into Your Branch
bash
git merge upstream/main

This will attempt to merge updates from upstream/main into your local main branch.

5. Resolve Any Merge Conflicts
Open each conflicted file noted by Git.
Edit the files to resolve conflicts (look for conflict markers: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>).
6. Commit the Merge Resolution
bash
git commit
7. Push the Updates to Your Fork
bash
git push origin main
