powershell:
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process 

eslint:
 npx (or pnpm exec) runs the package binary from the project’s .bin, so it picks up the project-local eslint (not globally).

mypy:
must install mypy in the uv environment 
uv sync --extra tests --extra mypy --extra dev --extra custom-data

the backend serves the built frontend from the frontend/dist folder 
(or whatever build directory you configured).

Details and quick checklist:
The backend uses a build_dir that points to:
<repo-root>/frontend/dist (when you build locally), or
a packaged build directory (fallback), or
a custom directory if you set UI.custom_build in config.toml.
Static public files (those served at /public) come from public_dir = APP_ROOT/public (so public when you run from the backend from the backend/public folder).

Routes of interest:
/ (index) -> served from build_dir/index.html
/assets/... -> served from build_dir/assets/...
/public/... -> served from APP_ROOT/public
What this means for your workflow

Editing frontend source files in src requires running the frontend build so dist is updated. Otherwise the backend will continue serving the old build files.
Commands (PowerShell):

1. Build everything (recommended): 
`pnpm run buildUi`
  Or just build the frontend:
`cd frontend
pnpm run build`

2.Then restart the backend:
`cd backend
uv run chainlit run .\chainlit\hello.py`

Faster dev option:
Run the frontend dev server (HMR) in one terminal and the backend in another
`# frontend (fast updates)
cd frontend
pnpm run dev

# backend (serves API / backend)
cd backend
uv run chainlit run .\chainlit\hello.py`

 you may open the Vite dev URL (usually http://localhost:5173) directly for instant frontend changes, 
 or adapt your setup to proxy if you want a single origin.

 3. Build for production and copy the custom frontend
 uv build
