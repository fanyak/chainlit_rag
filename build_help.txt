I understand your situation. You have a forked Chainlit repo with custom frontend components, and you want to use these customizations in a separately installed Chainlit app via pip. Let me break down the solution:

The Challenge
When you pip install chainlit, you get the published package with the standard frontend build. Your custom components are only in your forked repo and won't be available to the installed package.


The build process: When you run pnpm run buildUi:

It builds the libraries first (pnpm build:libs)
Then it builds the frontend with cd frontend && pnpm run build
This runs Vite, which bundles ALL your source files in src including your custom components like:
SearchBox.tsx
ButtonChip.tsx
All other components in components
What ends up in dist/:

index.html - the main app shell
assets/ - bundled JavaScript and CSS (contains ALL your components compiled together)
SVGs, CSS, and other static assets
Your custom components are NOT separate files - they're compiled into the JavaScript bundles in assets/


*Solution Options*

Option 1: Use Your Fork as the Pip Installation (Recommended)
Install Chainlit from your forked repo instead of the official package:
`pip install -e /path/to/your/chainlit_rag/backend`
The -e flag installs it in "editable mode", meaning:

Changes to Python code are immediately reflected
The frontend build (pnpm buildUi) output is used directly
Your custom components will be available
Steps:
In your forked repo: pnpm run buildUi (builds custom frontend)
Install editably: pip install -e ./backend
Now any Chainlit app using pip install chainlit will use your custom-built version


Option 2: Build and Publish Your Custom Package
Update pyproject.toml with your own package name/version
Build: python -m build in the backend
Install your custom wheel: pip install dist/your-package.whl


Option 3: Copy Built Frontend Files
If you want to keep the pip-installed version but add your customizations:

Find where Chainlit is installed:
`python -c "import chainlit; import os; print(os.path.dirname(chainlit.__file__))"`
Replace the frontend files with your built versions:
`cp -r /your/fork/backend/chainlit/frontend/dist/* /path/to/installed/chainlit/frontend/dist/`

When you copy ./backend/chainlit/frontend/dist/* to the installed package's frontend folder, you're getting:

✅ Your custom SearchBox component
✅ Your custom ButtonChip component
✅ All other custom components
✅ All their styles and dependencies


My Recommendation: Use Option 1 (Editable Install)
This is the cleanest approach because:

✅ Your custom components are always included
✅ Python changes take effect immediately
✅ Frontend rebuilds are picked up automatically
✅ No manual file copying needed
✅ Works across your entire machine

Quick Implementation:

# 1. Ensure your fork is fully built
cd /path/to/chainlit_rag
pnpm run buildUi

# 2. Uninstall the pip version (if installed)
pip uninstall chainlit -y

# 3. Install from your fork in editable mode
pip install -e ./backend

# 4. Now use Chainlit normally with your custom components
